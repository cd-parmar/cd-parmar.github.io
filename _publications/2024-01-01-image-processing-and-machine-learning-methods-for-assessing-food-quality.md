excerpt: 'This comprehensive review paper explores innovative strategies for quality assessment in agriculture and food industries, which offer greater efficiency and cost efficiency compared to traditional approaches. It highlights the use of sophisticated convolutional neural networks (CNNs) tailored specifically for wheat contamination detection with unsurpassed accuracy. Notably, an innovative noninvasive system employing machine learning achieved 92.57% accuracy when estimating apple freshness estimation. Hyperspectral imaging technology accurately classifies apple bruises with 97.33% accuracy, outclassing Yolov4-Tiny by 11%. An automated nondestructive scanning method evaluates meat quality while taking into account both its applications and challenges. Utilizing image processing and machine learning technologies, a cost-effective system has been created that accurately classifies and prices rice products, contributing greatly to product quality assessment methodologies as well as increasing competitiveness within agricultural and food technology industries.'
