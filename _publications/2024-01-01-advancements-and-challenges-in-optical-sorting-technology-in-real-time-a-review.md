excerpt: 'In the dynamic lands of the food industry, optical sorting technology has emerged as a particularly promising and transformative approach. This technology possesses the potential to revolutionize the quality enhancement and expeditious sorting of an extensive range of food items, encompassing not only fruits, but also in sorting the printed circuit boards and cancer cells. The versatility of optical sorting is underscored by the diverse techniques and methodologies available for food-related applications. Presently, numerous forward-thinking companies are harnessing the power of optical sorting machines to achieve precision and efficiency in the sorting of a variety of food products, including but not limited to tomatoes, berries, and potatoes. This study provides an overview of current developments in optical sorting, examining its limitations and potential uses in the food processing, healthcare industries and electronics domain. Furthermore, this paper examines the intricate software and hardware techniques integral to optical sorting systems, shedding light on their complexities and limitations. By identifying areas that necessitate further development, this study aims to contribute to the ongoing evolution of optical sorting technology, thereby facilitating its continued refinement and broader adoption across industries.'
