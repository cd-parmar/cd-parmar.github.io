excerpt: 'This research paper presents a novel design for a high gain, compact MIMO antenna with 4 ports for application in Sub-6GHz 5G. The antenna design utilizes an inset fed configuration and incorporates a defected ground structure (DGS). The antenna design is implemented on an FR-4 substrate having dimensions of 38 × 32 × 1.6 mm3, providing a compact form factor. The design achieves optimal performance by optimizing the dimensions of the radiating patches and incorporating isolated rectangular patches between adjacent radiating elements. The antennas reflection coefficient (S11), gain, directivity, surface charge distribution, and ECC are thoroughly evaluated. The results demonstrate a maximum gain of 3.14dB at 4GHz and an overall considerable gain for the desired frequency band. The half-power beamwidth is observed to be 198° for the co-polar field and 204° for the cross-polar field at 4GHz. These qualities render the suggested antenna apt for Sub-6GHz 5G applications offering enhanced signal strength, extended coverage range, and efficient spatial diversity. The presented design provides a valuable contribution to the advancement of wireless communication systems, offering practicality, cost-effectiveness, and performance advantages for next-generation wireless networks.'
