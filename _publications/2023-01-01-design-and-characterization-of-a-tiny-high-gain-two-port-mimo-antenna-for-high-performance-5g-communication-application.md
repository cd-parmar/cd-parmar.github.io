excerpt: 'This work describes the design, characterization, and MIMO configuration of a tiny broadband antenna for 5G applications. For systems with high channel capacities, a small MIMO antenna with polarization diversity is devised. Three distinct configurations are employed to create a MIMO antenna with adequate isolation, being estimated and assessed are general MIMO performances like low Envelope Correlation Coefficient (ECC), high Diversity gain (DG), and low Channel Capacity Loss (CCL). The idea of validating the efficiency of dual-port MIMO antennas. The physical design is included and proposed work compared with others design.'
