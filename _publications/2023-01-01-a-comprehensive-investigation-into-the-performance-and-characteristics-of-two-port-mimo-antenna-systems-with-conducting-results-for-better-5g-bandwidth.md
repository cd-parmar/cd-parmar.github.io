excerpt: 'This research paper presents a comprehensive investigation of the characterization and performance analysis of a two-port Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) antenna system. Conducting results are used to evaluate the antenna, allowing for a thorough examination of several parameters including S-parameters, radiation properties, gain, directivity, normalized directivity, total active reflection coefficient (TARC), multiple-element gain (MEG), envelope correlation coefficient (ECC), and diversity gain (DG). The experiments undertaken and their outputs offer insightful information on the behavior of the antenna and its potential for useful applications. The study's findings help to improve wireless communication scenarios' understanding of MIMO antenna systems and their performance'
