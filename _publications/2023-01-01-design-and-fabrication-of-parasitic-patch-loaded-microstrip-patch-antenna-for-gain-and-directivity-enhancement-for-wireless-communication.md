excerpt: 'Here, the paper introduces a updated version of a microstrip patch antenna achieved by incorporating changes in the number of parasitic patches. The original design exhibited suboptimal gain performance, prompting the exploration of alternative configurations. Through the proposed modifications, significant improvements in gain were achieved, particularly at the resonating frequency of 13.85GHz. The original design yielded a gain of 7.5675 at this frequency, whereas the new proposed design achieved a significantly higher gain of 1.4903e+001. Furthermore, the modified design demonstrated enhanced directivity, indicating a more focused and concentrated radiation pattern in the desired direction. These findings indicate that the suggested modifications have successfully improved the performance of the microstrip patch antenna.'
