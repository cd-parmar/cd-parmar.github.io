## Summary of course/Syllabus
Machine Intelligence concern with designing and developing of algorithms that allow machines, essentially computers, to evolve realistic or human like behavior based on the empirical data available. This course aims to discuss the building blocks of machine intelligence. The focus would be on how to develop algorithms that can automatically learn and recognize the complex pattern from the available data to make an intelligent decision which will be accepted to the users. Students are expected to learn the fundamental issues involved in designing algorithms for machine intelligence and pursue more insight towards understanding various machine learning algorithms.
