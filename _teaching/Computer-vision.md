## Summary of course/Syllabus
Computer vision focuses on the development of algorithms and techniques to analyze and interpret the visible world around us. This requires an understanding of the fundamental concepts related to multi-dimensional signal processing, feature extraction, stochastic optimization, etc. Knowledge of these concepts is necessary for research and further developments in the field of computer vision. Applications range from Biometrics, Medical diagnosis, document processing, mining of visual content, surveillance, advanced rendering, etc.
